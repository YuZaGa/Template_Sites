## Template Sites

This is a basic description of all the projects that I did involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- [IrisSecurityServices](https://github.com/YuZaGa/iris)

  >   A template site I did as a freelance project with full contact form functionality achieved through Netlify's form feature without the need of a backend. The best part is it has all the functionalities that any basic business would need for establishing an online presence.
